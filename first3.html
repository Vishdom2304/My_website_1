So guys, In this blog I will be talking about my education and along with my phase of life during those times. 
<hr><br>
So lets start with my high school times :- <br><br>
I completed my studies till <ins> class 10th from Sunbeam School, Jaunpur </ins> and I have to say this, What a school it was till class 10th, Excellent.<br>
The atmosphere so competitive and people so friendly, all these things made me work harder to be on the top.<br> I remember working hard through out those year just to become overall topper of all the sections which I managed to do only in the last year i.e. 10th itself. 
<br> And I can surely say, Those were one of the best times of my life, thanks to the fun that I did with my friends.

<div class = "para2">
Then comes the part of life full of hustle and struggle, lol.<br> <br>
I completed my <ins> 12th from RBVM sr. sec. school Jaunpur</ins>. This was also the time when I was preparing for, "JEE". Surely, tough time, it was. <br>
Anyway, Worked hard as much as I could and tried to do everything efficiently, learnt a lot of things both related to study and life. <br>
Then came the exams, gave them and unfortunately wasn't able to get any NIT, IIT, e.t.c. <br>
But again fortunately, got admission in IET Lucknow, One of the premiere institutes of Uttar Pradesh. <br>
And thus my college life, begun !
</div>

<div class= "para1">
And Now, its time for my current phase of life.<br><br>
So after all that of 12th, I got into college i.e. <ins> Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET), Lucknow </ins>. A nice institute with friendly peers and some supportive seniors, and an atomsphere full of healthy competition.<br>
I sometimes feel myself to be very fortunate for getting into such institute. Currently, I am in the 2nd year of Electronics and communication Engineering (ECE). <br>
This phase of my life is all about working hard  to improve my skills, Learning continiously and improving my personality too. <br><br>
And Ya, one more thing, i.e., <del style="color: white; font-size: 22px;"> looking forward to get some good internships. So please recruiters, hire me </del> !!!
